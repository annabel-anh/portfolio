                            I&apos;m a Computer Science student focusing on full-stack web development. My journey into
                            coding started with a love for graphic design, which naturally led me to the world of web
                            development. I get to combine my creative skills with the challenge of building robust
                            backend systems â€“ it&apos;s the best of both worlds!
                            I chose CS because it keeps me on my toes. There&apos;s always something new to learn in
                            this
                            fast-paced field, and I find that exciting.

                            When I&apos;m not coding, you&apos;ll probably find me reading a historical fiction, binging
                            British comedy shows, or hanging out with my three cats (Yes, I&apos;m one of those <i>childless cat ladies</i> that J.D. Vance was criticizing).
